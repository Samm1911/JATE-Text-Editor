# Usage

When you open the application, you will see a client server folder structure, then you run `npm run start` from the root directory, you will find that the application should start up the backend and serve the client, run the text editor application from the terminal, you will find that JavaScript files have been bundled using webpack, then run webpack plugins, you find that it generated HTML file, service worker, and a manifest file.

When you use next-gen JavaScript in the application, you will find that the text editor still functions in the browser without errors, open the text editor, you find that IndexedDB has immediately created a database storage.
Enter content and subsequently click off of the DOM window, you find that the content in the text editor has been saved with IndexedDB, reopen the text editor after closing it, you will find that the content in the text editor has been retrieved from IndexedDB.
When you click on the Install button, you download the web application as an icon on your desktop, and when you load the web application, you should have a registered service worker using workbox.

Register a service worker, you should have my static assets pre cached upon loading along with subsequent pages and static assets, when you deploy to Render, you should have proper build scripts for a webpack application.
